This artifact is a video recording of a performance reading given by Kathy Acker at the Montreal bar Foufounes Électriques in 1986. The recording is part of the Alan Lord fonds and the video and audio tapes are held at Concordia University’s Special Collections. The recording is split in two parts. In the first, Acker reads two excerpts from her novel *Empire of the Senseless* published two years later. In the second, the camera is reopened to capture what appears to be an encore. I am interested in this second segment where the presence of the crowd is more felt and heard then it was in the first part. 

## Layers

I have divided my annotations into four layers: transcript, speaker, audience, and environment. In the “transcript” layer appears what Acker reads from the pages she is holding. “Speaker” serves to collect what Acker says to her audience when she is not reading. Ervin Goffman, in his *Forms of Talk*, calls this “fresh talk” (171). Those are moments when the speaker’s formulation appears responsive to the present occasion and to the present listeners. The “audience” layer is used to gather the sounds coming from the crowd that seem to be produced as a form of interaction with the speaker’s performance. Those sounds are mainly vocal, by which I mean produced by a human larynx and inclusive of both words and non-linguistic sounds. This layer also tracks sounds of applause as non-vocal interactional sounds. The last layer, “environment,” allows me to identify non-vocal sounds coming from the manipulation of furniture and objects which I qualify, following Goffman, as “noise” (181). Noise happens when communication occurs. Noises are signals that impair the transmission of the intended signal, here Acker’s performance reading. Yet, in my analysis, I will argue that those noises may also be a form of interaction with the performance, or its deliberate disruption. 

## Context
### Les Foufounes Électriques

First, I want to situate Acker’s performance within Montreal’s artistic scene in the 80s, within feminist debates about pornography, and within punk and avant-garde performances. Acker’s performance is part of the Tuesday series at Les Foufounes Électriques (also known as “Foufs”) presented by the short-lived magazine *L’Oeil rechargeable: L’organe de la nouvelle culture* and *Ultimatum*. During the 1980s and 1990s, the bar situated in the Faubourg Saint-Laurent neighborhood is considered a major part of Montreal’s underground scene where beatniks, hippies and punks meet to attend music shows and poetry readings (Palardy 16). It is thus an appropriate location to welcome Acker and her work which are characterized as shocking and scandalous by a Radio-Canada report announcing the event (“Reportage Radio Canada”). Alan Lord, representing Les Foufounes Électriques, is interviewed and describes Acker as the “priestess of the new Beat Generation \[and\] of the punk literatures.”

### Bilingualism and the "two solitudes"

Radio-Canada’s report locates Acker’s performance at the confluence of many cultural manifestations of the 1980s. Acker’s visit in Montreal is an example of a bilingual experience that refuses to indulge in the mutual exclusion of the “two solitudes.” Acker’s coming is covered by francophone media such as *Le Devoir* and Radio-Canada (Royer C–2). The latter introduces Acker by a single sentence—chosen for its shock value—from a video excerpt of a previous performance where she says: “I quickly chose a raped body over a mutilated or a dead one.” ("Reportage Radio Canada"). Acker’s sentence is accompanied by a somewhat flawed translation: “J’ai rapidement choisi d’être violée, plutôt que d’être mutilée ou tuée.” Translated back to English, we could read: "I quickly chose *to be raped* rather than being mutilated or killed.” This imperfect attempt at rendering Acker’s words accessible to French speakers situates the writer’s visit at a time when no French translation of her work was available. Yet there is an interest for her work and her persona in Montreal’s underground scene, which gathers at the Foufs where the anglophone and the francophone musical and artistic communities meet (Palardy 55). 

### Pornography and feminisms

Later in this same Radio-Canada report, Acker is interviewed at the Foufs in front of a wall covered with graffiti where is written in big letters “NO PORN NO ART” ("Reportage Radio Canada"). The 1980s are years of internal conflict within different feminist movements that strongly disagree on the status of pornography both in the US and in Canada. Acker troubles the idea that feminism needs to get rid of pornography and of sex work with it. Acker appropriates the explicit and violent character of pornographic representations to dismantle binaries that uphold the norms producing gendered violence while claiming to prevent it (Ioanes 175). Her representation of sexuality follows her logic of contradiction according to which opposite terms are to be held together rather than being portrayed as mutually exclusive. In Acker’s novels, consent doesn’t exclude violence and there are no “good” or “bad” victims of sexual violence. Consent needs to be constantly renegotiated by her characters and by her readers and listeners (Ioanes 180, 183).
